# tool-chess
CHESS project provides a model-driven, component-based methodology and tool support for the development of high-integrity systems

OVERVIEW
PolarSys CHESS implements the CHESS UML profile, a specialization of the Modeling and Analysis of Real-Time and Embedded Systems (MARTE) profile, by producing extensions to Papyrus that  provide component-based engineering methodology and tool support for the development of high-integrity embedded systems in different domains like satellite on board systems.
The CHESS tool environment is composed by:
1.    a MARTE/UML profile,
2.    an extension to the Papyrus UML graphical editor that supports the notion of design views,
3.    a model validator that assesses the well-formedness of the model before model transformations can be undertaken, and
4.    a set of model to model and model to text transformations, the former for the purpose of model-based schedulability and dependability analysis and the latter for code generation toward multiple language targets.
